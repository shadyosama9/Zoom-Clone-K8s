## <a name="overview">ðŸ“‹ Overview</a>

This repository is part of a collection of three repositories that follow GitOps principles to deploy a Zoom clone application to an AWS EKS cluster.

The other repositories in this collection are:
- [Application code repository](https://github.com/shadyosama9/Zoom-Clone-App.git)
- [Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository](https://github.com/shadyosama9/Zoom-Clone-Infra)

This repository contains Kubernetes definitions for deploying application files along with the ArgoCD application file for creating an ArgoCD application.

### Included Files

- **zoom-deploy.yml**: Defines the deployment specifications for the application.
- **zoom-service.yml**: Configures the service settings to expose the application.
- **zoom-ingress.yml**: Sets up ingress rules for managing external access to the application.
- **argo-ingress.yml**: Contains the ingress configurations specifically for ArgoCD.
